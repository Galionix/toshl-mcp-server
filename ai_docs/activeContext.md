# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the Toshl MCP Server. The focus is now on testing, refinement, and ensuring all components work together correctly.

## Recent Changes

We have made significant progress on the project:

1. Set up the project structure with TypeScript, ESM modules, and necessary dependencies
2. Implemented the MCP server with support for resources and tools
3. Created API clients for all required Toshl endpoints
4. Implemented resource handlers for accounts, categories, tags, budgets, and user information
5. Implemented tool handlers for data retrieval and analysis
6. Added caching and error handling mechanisms
7. Created comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps in the development process are:

1. **Testing**

   - Test the server with real Toshl API credentials
   - Verify all resources and tools work as expected
   - Identify and fix any issues

2. **Refinement**

   - Optimize performance
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance caching strategy

3. **Documentation Enhancement**

   - Add more examples
   - Create tutorials for common use cases
   - Document API responses

4. **Deployment**

   - Create deployment scripts
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Prepare for production use

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Implementation

We have implemented Basic Authentication for the Toshl API:

1. **Current Implementation**: Basic Authentication with API token
2. **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding OAuth support

The current implementation uses environment variables to store the API token, which is secure and follows best practices.

### Caching Implementation

We have implemented in-memory caching with ETag support:

1. **Current Implementation**: Node-Cache with configurable TTL
2. **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding persistent cache for long-lived data

The current implementation respects Toshl's caching recommendations and optimizes API usage.

### Error Handling Implementation

We have implemented comprehensive error handling:

1. **Current Implementation**: Error mapping from Toshl API to MCP errors
2. **Future Enhancement**: Add more specific error types and better recovery mechanisms

The current implementation provides meaningful error messages and appropriate error codes.

### Resource and Tool Balance

We have implemented a balanced approach:

1. **Resources**: Direct data access for accounts, categories, tags, budgets, and user information
2. **Tools**: Parameterized operations for data retrieval and analysis

This approach provides flexibility for AI agents to access and analyze financial data.

## Implementation Status

1. **Core Functionality**: Implemented and ready for testing
2. **User Experience**: Designed for ease of use by AI agents
3. **Performance**: Optimized with caching and efficient data handling
4. **Extensibility**: Designed for future enhancements

## Open Questions

1. How can we further optimize the performance of the server?
2. What additional financial analysis tools would be most valuable?
3. How can we improve the documentation to make it more user-friendly?
4. What monitoring and logging enhancements would be beneficial?
