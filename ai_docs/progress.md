# Progress

## Current Status

We have completed the initial implementation of the Toshl MCP Server project. The project is now in a functional state with all core components implemented.

### Completed

- [x] Project requirements gathering
- [x] System architecture design
- [x] Technical stack selection
- [x] Memory bank documentation creation
- [x] Project setup and initialization
- [x] Core MCP server implementation
- [x] Authentication module implementation
- [x] API client implementation
- [x] Resource handlers implementation
- [x] Tool handlers implementation
- [x] Caching system implementation
- [x] Error handling implementation
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Entries endpoint implementation

### In Progress

- [x] Testing for entries endpoint (completed and fixed)
- [ ] Testing with real API credentials for other endpoints
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation enhancement

### Not Started

- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Advanced financial analysis tools

## What Works

The following components have been implemented and are ready for testing:

1. **Project Structure**: The project has been set up with TypeScript, ESM modules, and necessary dependencies.
2. **MCP Server**: The server has been implemented with support for resources and tools.
3. **API Clients**: Clients for all required Toshl endpoints have been created.
4. **Resource Handlers**: Handlers for accounts, categories, tags, budgets, user information, and entries have been implemented.
5. **Tool Handlers**: Handlers for data retrieval and analysis have been implemented.
6. **Support Systems**: Caching and error handling mechanisms have been added.
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation has been created.
8. **Tests**: Tests for the entries endpoint have been implemented and fixed, covering listEntries, getEntry, getEntrySums, and getEntryTimeline functionality.
   - Fixed parameter handling in the EntriesClient class to correctly pass parameters to the API
   - Added required currency parameter for the getEntrySums endpoint

## What's Left to Build

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**

   - [x] Write tests for entries API client
   - [x] Fix parameter handling in API clients
   - [ ] Write tests for other API clients
   - [ ] Write tests for resource handlers
   - [ ] Write tests for tool handlers

2. **Integration Tests**

   - [x] Test entries endpoint with real API credentials
   - [ ] Test other end-to-end flows
   - [ ] Test with mock data
   - [ ] Test remaining endpoints with real API credentials

3. **Performance Tests**
   - [ ] Test caching effectiveness
   - [ ] Test response times
   - [ ] Test concurrent requests

### Enhancements

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - [ ] Optimize caching strategy
   - [ ] Improve error recovery
   - [ ] Enhance logging

2. **Advanced Features**

   - [ ] Add more financial analysis tools
   - [ ] Implement data visualization
   - [ ] Add historical data analysis

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add OAuth support
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   - [ ] Add request validation

### Deployment

1. **Deployment Scripts**

   - [ ] Create Docker configuration
   - [ ] Set up deployment scripts
   - [ ] Prepare for cloud deployment

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**

   - [ ] Set up automated testing
   - [ ] Configure continuous integration
   - [ ] Set up continuous deployment

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Add health checks
   - [ ] Set up monitoring
   - [ ] Configure alerts

## Known Issues

While the core functionality has been implemented, there are some known issues and limitations:

1. **Authentication**: Currently only supports Basic Authentication with API token.
2. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases may not be handled properly.
3. **Caching**: In-memory caching may not be sufficient for large datasets.
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing has not been completed yet.

## Next Milestones

1. **Testing Completion**: Complete unit and integration tests.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize caching and error handling.
3. **Documentation Enhancement**: Add more examples and tutorials.
4. **Deployment Preparation**: Prepare for production deployment.

## Timeline Estimates

1. **Testing Completion**: 2-3 days
2. **Performance Optimization**: 1-2 days
3. **Documentation Enhancement**: 1-2 days
4. **Deployment Preparation**: 1-2 days

Total estimated time for remaining work: 5-9 days
