## Known Issues

As the project is in its initial phase, there are no implementation-specific issues yet. However, we have identified the following potential challenges:

1. **Authentication Complexity**: Implementing secure authentication while keeping it user-friendly.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Ensuring we don't exceed Toshl API rate limits.
3. **Caching Optimization**: Finding the right balance for cache invalidation.
4. **Error Recovery**: Implementing robust error recovery mechanisms.

## Next Milestones

1. **Project Setup**: Complete the initial project setup and configuration.
2. **Core Implementation**: Implement the MCP server base and authentication module.
3. **API Client**: Develop the Toshl API client with support for all required endpoints.
4. **Resource Handlers**: Implement resource handlers for all data types.
5. **Tool Handlers**: Implement tool handlers for data retrieval and analysis.
6. **Testing and Documentation**: Complete testing and documentation.

## Timeline Estimates

1. **Project Setup**: 1 day
2. **Core Implementation**: 2-3 days
3. **API Client**: 2-3 days
4. **Resource Handlers**: 3-4 days
5. **Tool Handlers**: 3-4 days
6. **Testing and Documentation**: 2-3 days

Total estimated time: 13-18 days
